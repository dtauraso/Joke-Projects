// have a graph of states and functions to be run so
// user can run a path of states
// the state will just return data for the user to use
// any contextual relathionship with the states and the data will be for reference only
// I have a graph for reference only
// have a function to run the states and return the last change in the store
// may also have a function to run back end algorithms that returns to the interface state
// to prevent potentially unwanted state changes to happen to the ui while the back end runs
